# Discord GNOME Theme

A GNOME theme for Discord, following the Adwaita style & GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (with whatever the Discord CSS lets me do).

## Requirements

1. Vesktop

   For enabling the Windows titlebar.

2. Settings > Language > Choose "English (US)"

   This allows for custom icons due to how they are identified in Discord.

3. Settings > Plugins > Enable "ThemeAttributes"

   This allows for icons in the settings dialog.

4. Settings > Vesktop Settings > Enable "Discord Titlebar"

   Optional, but recommended if you have titlebars.

### Optional additions

1. Remove Nitro references: https://github.com/CroissantDuNord/discord-adblock

   Nitro elements are not themed, but they should not look broken either way.

## Installation

Copy the following into the text box located in Settings > Themes > Online Themes:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricewind012/discord-gnome-theme/master/gnome.theme.css
```

or put [gnome.theme.css](./gnome.theme.css) in ~/.config/vesktop/themes for additional configuration. It's still updated automatically.
